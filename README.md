# Gtk-Sharp-Samples

<h1>What is GTK#?</h1>
<p>
  It’s a wrapper on the Gimp Toolkit, or GTK+ a cross platform GUI framework. Currently it works natively for any X server or the native Windows UI.
</p>
<p>
Although Gtk# is not limited to C#, any programming language in the .NET framework can use it, because it covers more than only the GTK API, it covers various other components of the Gnome Desktop.
</p>
<p>
  Gtk# is made up of the following components (assemblies), each one mapping the corresponding library:
